      <description>The earliest memory I had of arcade video games was watching my older brother and cousins going at the video game machines at Genting Highlands. While our parents were at the other types of games Genting Highlands was more popularly known for, we were generally let loose to play arcade games to our hearts&amp;rsquo; content.
Those were the magical days of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Galaxian, Donkey Kong, Frogger, Centipede and many, many more.</description>

      <description>I have been writing flocking simulations for a long time. I played around with it with Java but the earliest one I still have record of was with JRuby and Swing called Utopia. I wrote one using Shoes and that was the one in my Exploring Everyday Things witn R and Ruby book. Some time after (I was unhappy with Shoes in general), I re-wrote it again using Gosu, a 2D game development library for Ruby and C++.</description>

      <description>It may not seem obvious at first glance, but computer science algorithms are often inspired by nature and biological processes. Some of these algorithms include neural networks, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony, ant colony optimization, evolutionary algorithms and many more. In fact, you can consider biological processes to be simply algorithms that nature have come up with to solve problems. From that point of view it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why many of these algorithms are optimization heuristics and metaheuristics.</description>
