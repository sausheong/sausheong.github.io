        <h1>Privacy Policy for Sirocco AI Assistant</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 12-April-2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Sirocco AI Assistant ("Sirocco", "we", "us", or "our") respects the privacy of its users ("user", "you" or "your"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our AI assistant. We do not require sign-in and do not store any user data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            As Sirocco does not require users to sign in and does not store any personal data, there is no collection of personal information. All interactions with Sirocco are processed in real-time and are not stored, ensuring your privacy and security.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Local and Remote Language Model Providers</h2>
        <p>
            Sirocco can embed a local large language model (LLM) and also use remote LLM providers such as Anthropic and OpenAI. When using remote providers, queries are sent over the internet to these services. However, Sirocco does not retain any records of these queries or the responses provided by the remote LLM providers.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to ensuring the security of your information. However, as Sirocco does not collect or store any user data, there is no risk of breach of personal data from our service.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
